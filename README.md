# p5.web-serial
A p5.js library for using the Web Serial API to access devices like Arduino, no setup required.

# What is this and why?
This library is a wrapper for the [Web Serial API](https://web.dev/serial), which enables you to communicate with devices like Arduino without having to run a local server!

The Web Serial API is available on all desktop platforms (Chrome OS, Linux, macOS, and Windows) in Chrome 89. More about compatibliity can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API#browser_compatibility).

# Getting Started
To use this library, create a new p5.js sketch and import the library in the `index.html` file. 

You can download `p5.web-serial.js` and use it directly in your code:
```html
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="p5.web-serial.js">
```
Or, you can also use a CDN link available via []():
```html
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="">
```
